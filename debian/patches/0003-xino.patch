 .B trunc_xino | notrunc_xino
 Enable (or disable) the automatic truncation of xino files.
 The truncation is done by discarding the internal "hole" (unused blocks).
-When the number of blocks by the xino file for the branch exceeds
-the predefined upper limit, the automatic truncation begins. If the xino
-files contain few holes and the result size is still exceeds the upper
-limit, then the upper limit is added by \*[AUFS_XINO_TRUNC_STEP] blocks. The
-initial upper limit is \*[AUFS_XINO_TRUNC_INIT] blocks.
-Currently the type of branch fs supported by this automatic truncation
-is tmpfs or ramfs only.

 It means that you have two xino files during the copy, and you should
 pay attention to the free space of the filesystem where the xino file is
 located.
+If the free space is not large enough to hold two xino files temporary
+during the copy, then the truncation fails and the xino file will go on
+growing. For such case, you should move the xino file to another larger
+partition, and move it back to where it was (if you want). To do this,
+use `xino=' mount option. During this move, the xino file is truncated
+automatically.
 
 If you do not want to truncate it (it may be slow) when you delete a
 branch, specify `notrunc_xib' after `del' mount option.
